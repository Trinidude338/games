# Games written using the curses library
Here are some games I've made out of boredom:

- Missile - You're the commander of a ship flying through space but on your journey you encounter different enemies that try to attack you. Take them out before they take you out.

- Flappy - Flap your wings and fly through the pipes but careful not to hit one.

- Snake - You're a snake, the more food you eat; the longer you get but be careful not to touch the walls or yourself.

- Tetris - Stack the falling blocks on top & next to each other. If you fill a horizontal line, it will clear but be warned, if you stack up to the top and there's no more space for blocks to fall, you lose.

- Tron - Two player game that wherever you go a trail follows you, if you touch the other players trail or the wall, you lose.

- Doom Clone - ncurses 3D engine, soon to be first person shooter.
